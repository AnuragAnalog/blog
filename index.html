An undergrad'22, I am very much passionate about Machine learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence. Over the past two years, I have spent a considerable amount of time and effort in learning the theory behind the subject. It amazed me and I have been dedicating my education to that ever since. I have done a number of courses online, been reading a lot of articles, even enrolled in two related courses this year at my university. I cannot put into words how excited I am about the application of Machine learning and AI, and about the ways, it can improve the things we can do with them.
